Good Things Happen When Bread Meets Eggs
This dish — a pita, filled with an herb-packed omelet — is a mash-up worth replicating.

The original egg on a roll was not bought from a cart on the streets of Manhattan, I imagine, but it is now a cheap, fast, made-to-order breakfast for New Yorkers of all stripes in a hurry. Wrapped in paper, the sandwich is as unassuming as it is satisfying.

What’s not to like? Egg-and-bread anything is a great combination, no matter how plain or fancy: fried egg sandwiches; soft-scrambled eggs on good buttered bread, a crisp baguette, perhaps; poached eggs on English muffins.

Though I can’t prove it, I suspect the first egg and bread combinations began in various regions of the Middle East, North Africa and South Asia — all cuisines in which bread plays a part. Think of the egg-filled Tunisian brik, for example, or spicy Indian scrambled eggs with chapati.
